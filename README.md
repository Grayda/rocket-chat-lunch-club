# rocket-chat-lunch-club
A silly little integration for Rocket.Chat that picks a random restaurant when you send a food emoji

## But why?
Every Friday (or whenever Nick hasn't bothered to bring his lunch, which is probably every day) we get takeaway. We usually spend half the morning trying to decide on a place in between being sidetracked by our work. Eventually we pick somewhere, sometimes using "Wheel Decide", then argue over who is going to collect and / or pay for it.

This integration attempts to help us decide on a place, so we're free to spend our time doing more useful things, like arguing over who is going to collect

## How do I use it?
Open the .js file and replace the values inside with your own. Add a new integration in Rocket.Chat and assign it to a room. Then when you can't decide what to have for lunch, you send a food emoji and it'll "spin the wheel" and return a restaurant, along with their menu so you can just click on it and go.

You could use the attachments field to include a PDF menu, or whatever you want to do with it.
